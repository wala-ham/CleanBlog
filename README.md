# Clean Architecture with SQL Server

This repository demonstrates the implementation of Clean Architecture principles in a project using SQL Server as the database. Clean Architecture is an architectural pattern that promotes separation of concerns and maintainability by organizing code into distinct layers.

## Introduction

Clean Architecture is an architectural design philosophy that encourages the separation of concerns and the independence of the application's business rules from the external frameworks and tools. This approach aims to create a scalable and maintainable codebase by organizing it into layers, such as entities, use cases, and interfaces.

SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. It provides a robust and scalable solution for storing and managing data in a structured manner.

## Clean Architecture

The Clean Architecture pattern consists of several layers:

- **Entities:** Represent the core business objects.
- **Use Cases:** Contain the application-specific business rules.
- **Interfaces:** Define the contracts and boundaries between layers.
- **Frameworks and Drivers:** Contain the implementation details such as databases, UI, and external frameworks.

This separation enables the application to adapt to changes in the external environment without affecting the core business logic.

## SQL Server

SQL Server is a powerful relational database management system that supports the storing and retrieval of data. It provides features like transactions, stored procedures, and triggers, making it suitable for various types of applications.
