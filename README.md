# Clean Architecture with SQL Server

This repository demonstrates the implementation of Clean Architecture principles in a project using SQL Server as the database. Clean Architecture is an architectural pattern that promotes separation of concerns and maintainability by organizing code into distinct layers.

## Introduction

Clean Architecture is an architectural design philosophy that encourages the separation of concerns and the independence of the application's business rules from the external frameworks and tools. This approach aims to create a scalable and maintainable codebase by organizing it into layers, such as entities, use cases, and interfaces.

SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. It provides a robust and scalable solution for storing and managing data in a structured manner.

## Clean Architecture

The Clean Architecture pattern consists of several layers:


- **Domain:** Represents the core business objects. It defines the entities and the fundamental business logic without any dependencies on external frameworks or tools.

- **Application:** Contains the application-specific business rules. This layer orchestrates the flow of data between the entities and use cases, ensuring that the business logic is implemented in a way that aligns with the application's requirements.

- **Infrastructure:** Defines the contracts and boundaries between layers. It consists of interfaces that specify how data should be persisted, how external services should be integrated, and any other interactions between the application and the outside world.

- **Api:** Contains the implementation details such as databases, UI, and external frameworks. This layer adapts the application to the specific technologies and tools required for execution. It includes database connections, user interfaces, and any external dependencies.

This separation enables the application to adapt to changes in the external environment without affecting the core business logic.

## SQL Server

SQL Server is a powerful relational database management system that supports the storing and retrieval of data. It provides features like transactions, stored procedures, and triggers, making it suitable for various types of applications.
